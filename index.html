            This project examines the memories of people by using an AI. It takes a lifetime of lived experience for a poet to write a poem, but for an AI itâ€™ll only take a few seconds.  <br> 
            <br> Is this because the AI has been fed all the memories of these people? Does that make their memories alive again and should that be the case since memories are something deeply personal? By limiting the time it takes for words to appear, would the AI-generated poems fell more human-like? And will the audience be able to tell which ones are real and which are fake?  </div>
